### What is it ?
This repository contains my contribution to the [Oze-Energie challenge](https://challengedata.ens.fr/fr/challenge/18/oze_energies_-_optimiser_la_consommation_denergies.html) from the **Challenge Data 2016-2017** hosted by the ENS school of Lyon. In this competition, one has to predict five variables corresponding to the energy consumption of four different buildings, based on five input variables.

Input : x1; x2; x3; x4; x5
Output : y1; y2; y3; y4; y5


Data are a bit dirty, some values are missing, and not all the variables are to predict for all buildings. 
First approach got rid of rows ith missing values, next will try to learn on more realistic data after inputing the missing ones.

**See the jupyter notebook for more insights!**
